 ### EQUIPMENT MODULES ###
  # Armor
    armour_standard_plate: "Standard armor"
    armour_standard_plate_desc: "The usual standard armor components are attached to the frame of the power armor."

    armour_composite_plate: "Composite armor"
    armour_composite_plate_desc: "Composite armor attached to the frame of power armor, allows you to move faster on the battlefield, but protects worse."

    armour_harded_plate: "Harded armor"
    armour_harded_plate_desc: "Reinforced armor attached to the frame of power armor, allows you to better protect the soldier, but seriously slows down movement on the battlefield."

    armour_welded_rebar: "Welded rebar"
    armour_welded_rebar_desc: "Fittings and other scrap metal welded to the power armor in the hope of reducing the damage received."

  # Power Plant
    armour_battery: "Microfusion cell"
    armour_battery_desc: "Simple microfusion cell used to power energy weapons can also be used to power power armor, however, they discharge very quickly during active operations."
 
    armour_fusion_core: "Fusion core"
    armour_fusion_core_desc: "A fairly rare universal fuel cell, allows you to continuously fuel any kind of power armor, as well as heavy types of energy weapons or even entire settlements of survivors."

    armour_reactor_plant: "Micronuclear reactor TX-28"
    armour_reactor_plant_desc: "A 60 kW micronuclear reactor, used before the war as the main source of energy in power armor, this device is located in an isolated container on the back."

    armour_enclave_reactor_plant: "Enclave TX-28 micronuclear reactor"
    armour_enclave_reactor_plant_desc: "A 60 kW micronuclear reactor modified by the enclave to increase reliability due to improved cooling."

  # Servo
    armour_primitive_servo: "Primitive servos"
    armour_primitive_servo_desc: "Primitive servos created in conditions of lack of resources and lack of necessary experience in the maintenance of power armor, however, these servos allow power armor to perform tasks in the absence of an alternative."

    armour_simple_servo: "Kinetic servos"
    armour_simple_servo_desc: "These servos are almost indistinguishable from standard servos, however, they have some minor defects that sometimes manifest themselves during combat."

    armour_advance_servo: "Optimized servos"
    armour_advance_servo_desc: "These servos meet all the standards of the pre-war era, thanks to them, the mobility of power armor increases significantly."

    armour_high_pressure_hydraulic_servo: "High pressure hydraulic servo"
    armour_high_pressure_hydraulic_servo_desc: "The improvement of the hydraulic system of the servos allows us to use heavier combat armor."

  # Special
    # Helmet
